# Blothru Api
 
This is a backend for a beauty app that brings together professional stylists and customers. Customers can register then book a preffered stylist for a certain service. Stylists register then send an application with supporting documents to offer services within their expertise. The applictions are reviewed by an admin and either approved or declined. On approval the stylist will be enlisted as a service provider and customers can book service from them.
